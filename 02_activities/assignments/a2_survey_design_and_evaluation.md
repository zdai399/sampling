# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type: 
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of the survey is to understand the underlying reasons behind the high turnover rate across departments within entry- and lower level positions 
and identify how to make changes to improve employee satisfaction. 
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
The target population is current and previous employees who left over the past few months (let's say 3-6 months) in entry- and lower level positions across all departments in the company. 

The sampling frame is HR records of all current employees and terminated employees who left within the last 3-6 months with record of contact information (personal email or phone). 

The sampling units are each individual employee from above-mentioned groups. 

The observational units are each employee who fills out the survey. 

The overall sampling strategy is stratified random sampling to sample from current or past employees from various departments and tenure at the company.
Since each strata will be different sizes, we should sample more in larger groups. 
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. Which best describes your employment status with the company? 
A. Active  B. Left the company in the last 3 months C. Left the company more than 3-6 months ago
2. Which department do/did you belong to? 
()Product  ()IT ()HR ()Finance ()Operation ()Other:XX
#For this question, the surveyee can choose multiple departments and they are also given the option to write in the Other option if their department was not mentioned. 
#For the options, I would list all major departments in the company (options given only as examples). 
3. How long have you been/were you working at the company?
A. less than 3 months B. 3-6 months C. 6 months- 1 year D. 1-2 years E. 2 years or more
4. How satisfied are you with your experience working at the company?
Scale 1- very dissatisfied, 2- dissatisfied, 3. Neutral, 4. satisfied, 5. very satisfied
5. Which factors have negatively impacted your work experience? 
()Salary ()Benefits ()Workload ()Career support ()Work environment ()Schedule ()Other: XX
6. Which factors have positively impacted your work experience?
()Salary ()Benefits ()Workload ()Career support ()Work environment ()Schedule ()Other: XX
7. What is one thing you wish would change that would improve your experience? 

#Question 5-7 are used to identify how changes can be implemented to improve employee retension. 
Factors are given because these are common definitions that should apply to most employees, also makes it easier for employees to pinpoint what might have impacted their decisions quickly. 
Question 7 is there for consideration of completeness of the survey. We want to get more feedback from the employees, even though it will take us longer to go through the responses. 
However, answers to question 5 and 6 can be quicker changes for implementation. 
```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
1. Sample type: Stratified single random sampling without replacement
2. Sample size: The Target sample size was 20,000, and the actual number of respondents was 16,149. 
3. Target population: Direct quotes are taken from document referenced in 13:
"The target population for the survey included all persons 15 years of age and older in Canada, excluding:
          1. Residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut;
          2. Full-time residents of institutions".  
4. Sampling frame: Direct quotes are taken from the document referenced in 13:
          "1. Lists of telephone numbers in use (both landline and cellular) available to Statistics Canada from various sources (Telephone companies, Census of population, etc.);
           2. The Address Register (AR): List of all dwellings within the ten provinces".
5. Survey mode(s): Surveys were done as self-completed questionaire (rEQ) and computer assisted telephone interviews (iEQ), and also telephone interviews.
6. Timeline: Data was collected from September 4th to December 28th 2018. 
7. Response rate: 41.9%
8. Weights: Weights were adjusted based on household (one household can be reached multiple times) and the removal of out-of-scope record and nonresponse adjustment. 
Then person weight is calculated by "Initial Household Weight x Factor 1 x Number of eligible household members". The weight is then adjusted for rejective sampling, and external totals. 
External totals include stratum adjustment, income adjustment, province-age-sex adjustment and rank ratio adjustments. 
9. Data processing: Survey responses were made into forms for tabulation and data analysis. 
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc: Imputation was done to provide complete data in the case of partial non-response and to fill in missing data for some item. 
11. Sources of error: Some examples mentioned include interviewers misunderstanding instructions, respondents making mistakes when answering questions, answers are entered into the system incorrectly;
errors introduced when processing and the tabulation of the data. 
12. Limitations, known biases, etc: Residents of certain regions were excluded from the survey. Survey also depends on phone calls or electronics use, therefore can be limiting for some people. 
The data collection time is also relatively short which could limit responses from people. 
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used: 2018_GSS33GVP_PUMFGuide.pdf
